## Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of this textbook. This is a sample chapter to demonstrate the structure and features of the OpenTextbook theme.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Understand the basic structure of chapters
- Learn how to navigate between chapters
- See examples of various content types

## Chapter Content

### Text and Paragraphs

This is a regular paragraph with standard text formatting. The theme is designed for optimal readability with appropriate line spacing, font size, and contrast ratios.

You can write multiple paragraphs to organize your content effectively.

### Code Examples

Inline code can be formatted like this: `const example = "hello world"`.

Code blocks are also supported with copy-to-clipboard functionality:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the textbook`;
}

greet("Reader");
```

You can also include code in different languages:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculate the average of a list of numbers."""
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
average = calculate_average(scores)
print(f"Average score: {average}")
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Lists

Unordered lists:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

Ordered lists:

1. First step

### Blockquotes

The theme supports several types of accessible blockquotes that are automatically styled:

> **Example** This is an example blockquote for code examples or demonstrations. Use it to highlight practical applications.

> **Important** This is an important blockquote for critical information. It draws attention to must-know content.

### Images

You can include images in your chapters. They will automatically scale to fit the content width:
